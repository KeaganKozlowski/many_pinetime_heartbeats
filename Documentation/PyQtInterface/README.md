# PyQtInterface Documentation
## 1. Introduction
### What is the PyQtInterface Folder?
The folder contains a collection of scripts which makeup the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the application.

However, this does not mean all the scripts are used, as some feature code snippet examples. Which proves useful when debugging the Main_UI script.

## 2. External Libraries
### PyQt6
* **Purpose**: Enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android. 
* **Documentation**: [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/)<br>
#### **Why PyQt6?**
* PyQt6 is the most current version of PyQt which means it has the most up-to date features and bug fixes compared to older versions.
* PyQt has been around longer than PySide which means the community is more active allowing for questions to be answered quicker or the answer already exists online.
* PyQt gets the latest Qt features faster and often in a more stable state than PySide.
* PyQt has more extensive documentation than that of PySide.

## 3. Internal Libraries
### Sys
* **Purpose**: Provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the Python Runtime Enviroment.
* **Documentation**: [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)<br>

## 4. Error Handling
**Will add more content when errors are discovered.**
